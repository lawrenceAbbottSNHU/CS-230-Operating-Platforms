# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a new client of my employer Creative Technology Solutions (CTS). They have asked CTS to advise them on how to best reach their goal of developing a web-based game that will be made available to multiple platforms. They already have a successful Android game, which will be the model for how the game will be developed on additional platforms.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel I was direct and thorough in the Recommendations section of the document. In addition to providing the recommended choice for each section, I provide additional information that supports the recommendation. In some instances, I go further and describe specific benefits of our chosen recommendation over other considerations. I believe this approach gives the client added confidence in our ability to best meet their needs.  

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having developed the design document prior to developing the code, I had the benefit of considering the design constraints and had a rough idea of what how the implementation might look from a high level. As is often the case in software development, it can be helpful to theorize how to implement something prior to jumping right into the code.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I can see now that it would have been better to provide more detail in the Storage Management subsection of the Recommendations section. In hindsight I could have provided a more convincing argument if I had compared MySQL to another option and then detailed why MySQL was ultimately our recommendation and why.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
First off, the user’s needs should be at the forefront of your mind when designing because that is who you are developing the software for. If the users are not happy with how the software is designed, it will likely not be long before they decide that some other option is a better fit for them. I, myself, in addition to being a software developer, am a user and as a user I know that when the design works well for my needs it gives me a sense of trust in the software. Additionally, I am from that point forward more inclined to try out other software from that software company. This is how brand loyalty is established.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started with the design constraints. The design constraints need to be considered first because if they are not appropriately accounted for the potential for failure is greatly increased. A lot of time and money could be wasted if design choices are made without considering the design constraints. Then, I considered the user and made design choices that would provide the most optimal user experience. In the future, I’ll probably stick with this general approach, however, there will likely be additional constraints to consider in addition to those that were considered for this project. Financial and scheduling constraints are two that come to mind.
